# SESSION  
  
This is plainly used to expose the CSI package to the window's session object, which can then be used in the frontend. Modify whatever you want, but remember to execute `npm run build` to get the asset generated to client/assets folder which is needed if you want to access CSI from the frontend.  
  
Make sure node is installed prior to executing these commands -  
  
> `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies  
  
> `npm run build` to build the script with your changes
